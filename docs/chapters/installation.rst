Installation
============
Bastille is available in the official FreeBSD ports tree at
``sysutils/bastille``. Binary packages are available in quarterly and latest
repositories.

Current version is ``1.1.0.251001``.

To install from the FreeBSD package repository:

* quarterly repository may be older version
* latest repository will match recent ports


pkg
---

.. code-block:: shell

  pkg install bastille
  bastille setup

To install from source (don't worry, no compiling):

ports
-----

.. code-block:: shell

  make -C /usr/ports/sysutils/bastille install clean
  bastille setup

git
---

.. code-block:: shell

  git clone https://github.com/BastilleBSD/bastille.git
  cd bastille
  make install
  bastille setup

This method will install the latest files from GitHub directly onto your
system. It is verbose about the files it installs (for later removal), and also
has a ``make uninstall`` target. You may need to manually copy the sample
config into place before Bastille will run. (ie;
``/usr/local/etc/bastille/bastille.conf.sample``)

Note: installing using this method overwrites the version variable to match
that of the source revision commit hash.
