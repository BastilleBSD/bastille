## 0.6-beta
This document outlines the basic usage of the Bastille container management
framework. This release is still considered beta.

Network Requirements
====================
Several networking options can be performed regarding the user needs.  Basic
containers can support IP alias networking, where the IP address is assigned to
the host interface and used by the container, generally known as "shared IP"
based containers.

If you administer your own network and can assign and remove unallocated IP
addresses, then "shared IP" is a simple method to get started. If this is the
case, skip ahead to ZFS Support.

If you are not the administator of the network, or perhaps you're in "the
cloud" someplace and are only provided a single IP4 address. In this situation
Bastille can create and attach containers to a private loopback interface. The
host system then acts as the firewall, permitting and denying traffic as
needed. (This method has been my primary method for years.)

**bastille0**

First, create the loopback interface:

```shell
ishmael ~ # sysrc cloned_interfaces+=lo1
ishmael ~ # sysrc ifconfig_lo1_name="bastille0"
ishmael ~ # service netif cloneup
```

Create the firewall config, or merge as necessary.

/etc/pf.conf
------------
```
ext_if="vtnet0"

set block-policy return
scrub in on $ext_if all fragment reassemble
set skip on lo

table <jails> persist
nat on $ext_if from <jails> to any -> ($ext_if)

## static rdr example
## rdr pass inet proto tcp from any to any port {80, 443} -> 10.17.89.45

# Enable dynamic rdr (see below)
rdr-anchor "rdr/*"

block in all
pass out quick modulate state
antispoof for $ext_if inet
pass in inet proto tcp from any to any port ssh flags S/SA keep state

# make sure you also open up ports that you are going to use for dynamic rdr
# pass in inet proto tcp from any to any port <rdr-start>:<rdr-end> flags S/SA keep state
# pass in inet proto udp from any to any port <rdr-start>:<rdr-end> flags S/SA keep state

```

* Make sure to change the `ext_if` variable to match your host system interface.
* Make sure to include the last line (`port ssh`) or you'll end up locked
out of a remote system.

Note: if you have an existing firewall, the key lines for in/out traffic to
containers are:

```
table <jails> persist
nat on $ext_if from <jails> to any -> ($ext_if)

## rdr example
## rdr pass inet proto tcp from any to any port {80, 443} -> 10.17.89.45
```

The `nat` routes traffic from the loopback interface to the external interface
for outbound access.

The `rdr pass ...` will redirect traffic from the host firewall on port X to
the ip of container Y. The example shown redirects web traffic (80 & 443) to the
container at `10.17.89.45`.

Finally, enable and (re)start the firewall:

## dynamic rdr 

The `rdr-anchor "rdr/*"` enables dynamic rdr rules to be setup using the 
`bastille rdr` command at runtime - eg.

```
  bastille rdr <jail> tcp 2001 22 # Redirects tcp port 2001 on host to 22 on jail
  bastille rdr <jail> udp 2053 53 # Same for udp
  bastille rdr <jail> list        # List dynamic rdr rules
  bastille rdr <jail> clear       # Clear dynamic rdr rules
```

  Note that if you are rediirecting ports where the host is also listening
  (eg. ssh) you should make sure that the host service is not listening on 
  the cloned interface - eg. for ssh set sshd_flags in rc.conf

## Enable pf rules

```shell
ishmael ~ # sysrc pf_enable="YES"
ishmael ~ # service pf restart
```

At this point you'll likely be disconnected from the host. Reconnect the ssh
session and continue.

This step only needs to be done once in order to prepare the host.


ZFS support
===========

![BastilleBSD Twitter Poll](/docs/images/bastillebsd-twitter-poll.png)

Bastille 0.4 added initial support for ZFS. `bastille bootstrap` and `bastille
create` will generate ZFS volumes based on settings found in the
`bastille.conf`. This section outlines how to enable and configure Bastille for
ZFS.

Two values are required for Bastille to use ZFS. The default values in the
`bastille.conf` are empty. Populate these two to enable ZFS.

```shell
## ZFS options
bastille_zfs_enable=""                                  ## default: ""
bastille_zfs_zpool=""                                   ## default: ""
bastille_zfs_prefix="bastille"                          ## default: "${bastille_zfs_zpool}/bastille"
bastille_zfs_mountpoint=${bastille_prefix}              ## default: "${bastille_prefix}"
bastille_zfs_options="-o compress=lz4 -o atime=off"     ## default: "-o compress=lz4 -o atime=off"
```

**Example**

```shell
ishmael ~ # sysrc -f /usr/local/etc/bastille/bastille.conf bastille_zfs_enable=YES
ishmael ~ # sysrc -f /usr/local/etc/bastille/bastille.conf bastille_zfs_zpool=ZPOOL_NAME
```

Replace `ZPOOL_NAME` with the zpool you want Bastille to use. Tip: `zpool list`
and `zpool status` will help. If you get 'no pools available' you are likely
not using ZFS and can safely ignore these settings.


bastille bootstrap
------------------
Before you can begin creating containers, Bastille needs to "bootstrap" a
release.  Current supported releases are 11.3-RELEASE, 12.0-RELEASE and
12.1-RELEASE.

**Important: If you need ZFS support see the above section BEFORE
bootstrapping.**

To `bootstrap` a release, run the bootstrap sub-command with the
release version as the argument.

**FreeBSD 11.3-RELEASE**
```shell
ishmael ~ # bastille bootstrap 11.3-RELEASE
```

**FreeBSD 12.0-RELEASE**
```shell
ishmael ~ # bastille bootstrap 12.0-RELEASE
```

**FreeBSD 12.1-RELEASE**
```shell
ishmael ~ # bastille bootstrap 12.1-RELEASE
```

**HardenedBSD 11-STABLE-BUILD-XX**
```shell
ishmael ~ # bastille bootstrap 11-STABLE-BUILD-XX
```

**HardenedBSD 12-STABLE-BUILD-XX**
```shell
ishmael ~ # bastille bootstrap 12-STABLE-BUILD-XX
```

> `bastille bootstrap RELEASE update` to apply updates automatically at bootstrap.

This command will ensure the required directory structures are in place and
download the requested release. For each requested release, `bootstrap` will
download the base.txz. If you need more than base (eg; ports, lib32, src) you
can configure the `bastille_bootstrap_archives` in the configuration file. By
default this value is set to "base". Additional components are added, space
separated, without file extension.

Bastille will attempt to fetch the required archives if they are not found in
the `cache/$RELEASE` directory. 

Downloaded artifacts are stored in the `cache/RELEASE` directory. "bootstrapped"
releases are stored in `releases/RELEASE`.

Advanced: If you want to create your own custom base.txz, or use an unsupported
variant of FreeBSD, drop your own base.txz in `cache/RELEASE/base.txz` and
`bastille bootstrap` will attempt to extract and use it.

The bootstrap subcommand is generally only used once to prepare the system. The
other use cases for the bootstrap command are when a new FreeBSD version is
released and you want to start building containers on that version, or
bootstrapping templates from GitHub or GitLab.

See `bastille update` to ensure your bootstrapped releases include the latest
patches.


bastille create
---------------
`bastille create` uses a bootstrapped release to create a lightweight container
system. To create a container simply provide a name, release and a private
(rfc1918) IP address. Optionally provide a network interface name to attach the
IP at container creation.

- name
- release (bootstrapped)
- ip
- interface (optional)


```shell
ishmael ~ # bastille create folsom 12.0-RELEASE 10.17.89.10
Valid: (10.17.89.10).

NAME: folsom.
IP: 10.17.89.10.
RELEASE: 12.0-RELEASE.

syslogd_flags: -s -> -ss
sendmail_enable: NO -> NONE
cron_flags:  -> -J 60
```

This command will create a 12.0-RELEASE container assigning the 10.17.89.10 ip
address to the new system.

Optionally `bastille create [ -T | --thick ]` will create a container with a
private base. This is sometimes referred to as a "thick" container (whereas the
shared base container is a "thin").

```shell
ishmael ~ # bastille create -T folsom 12.0-RELEASE 10.17.89.10
```

I recommend using private (rfc1918) ip address ranges for your containers.
These ranges include:

- 10.0.0.0/8
- 172.16.0.0/12
- 192.168.0.0/16

If your Bastille host also uses private (rfc1918) addresses, use a different
range for your containers. ie; Host uses 192.168.0.0/16, containers use 10.0.0.0/8.

Bastille does its best to validate the submitted ip is valid. I generally use
the 10.0.0.0/8 range for containers.


bastille start
--------------
To start a containers you can use the `bastille start` command.

```shell
ishmael ~ # bastille start folsom
[folsom]:
folsom: created

```


bastille stop
-------------
To stop a containers you can use the `bastille stop` command.

```shell
ishmael ~ # bastille stop folsom
[folsom]:
folsom: removed

```


bastille restart
----------------
To restart a container you can use the `bastille restart` command.

```shell
ishmael ~ # bastille restart folsom
[folsom]:
folsom: removed

[folsom]:
folsom: created

```

bastille list
-------------
This sub-command will show you the running containers on your system.

```shell
ishmael ~ # bastille list
 JID             IP Address      Hostname                      Path
 bastion         10.17.89.65      bastion                       /usr/local/bastille/jails/bastion/root
 unbound0        10.17.89.60      unbound0                      /usr/local/bastille/jails/unbound0/root
 unbound1        10.17.89.61      unbound1                      /usr/local/bastille/jails/unbound1/root
 squid           10.17.89.30      squid                         /usr/local/bastille/jails/squid/root
 nginx           10.17.89.45      nginx                         /usr/local/bastille/jails/nginx/root
 folsom          10.17.89.10      folsom                        /usr/local/bastille/jails/folsom/root
```

You can also list non-running containers with `bastille list containers`.  In
the same manner you can list archived `logs`, downloaded `templates`, and
`releases` and `backups`.  Providing the `-j` flag to list alone will result in
JSON output.


bastille service
----------------
To restart services inside a containers you can use the `bastille service`
command.

```shell
ishmael ~ # bastille service folsom postfix restart
[folsom]
postfix/postfix-script: stopping the Postfix mail system
postfix/postfix-script: starting the Postfix mail system

```


bastille cmd
------------
To execute commands within the container you can use `bastille cmd`.

```shell
ishmael ~ # bastille cmd folsom ps -auxw
[folsom]:
USER   PID %CPU %MEM   VSZ  RSS TT  STAT STARTED    TIME COMMAND
root 71464  0.0  0.0 14536 2000  -  IsJ   4:52PM 0:00.00 /usr/sbin/syslogd -ss
root 77447  0.0  0.0 16632 2140  -  SsJ   4:52PM 0:00.00 /usr/sbin/cron -s
root 80591  0.0  0.0 18784 2340  1  R+J   4:53PM 0:00.00 ps -auxw

```


bastille pkg
------------
To manage binary packages within the container use `bastille pkg`.

```shell
ishmael ~ # bastille pkg folsom install vim-console git-lite zsh
[folsom]:

The PKG sub-command can, of course, do more than just `install`. The
expectation is that you can fully leverage the pkg manager. This means,
`install`, `update`, `upgrade`, `audit`, `clean`, `autoremove`, etc.

```


bastille destroy
----------------
Containers can be destroyed and thrown away just as easily as they were
created.  Note: containers must be stopped before destroyed.

```shell
ishmael ~ # bastille stop folsom
[folsom]:
folsom: removed

ishmael ~ # bastille destroy folsom
Deleting Container: folsom.
Note: container console logs not destroyed.
/usr/local/bastille/logs/folsom_console.log

```

bastille template
-----------------
Looking for ready made CI/CD validated [Bastille
Templates](https://gitlab.com/BastilleBSD-Templates)?

Bastille supports a templating system allowing you to apply files, pkgs and
execute commands inside the container automatically.

Currently supported template hooks are: `LIMITS`, `INCLUDE`, `PRE`, `FSTAB`,
`PKG`, `OVERLAY`, `SYSRC`, `SERVICE`, `CMD`.
Planned template hooks include: `PF`, `LOG`

Templates are created in `${bastille_prefix}/templates` and can leverage any of
the template hooks. Simply create a new directory in the format project/repo,
ie; `username/base-template`

```shell
mkdir -p /usr/local/bastille/templates/username/base-template
```

To leverage a template hook, create an UPPERCASE file in the root of the
template directory named after the hook you want to execute. eg;

```shell
echo "zsh vim-console git-lite htop" > /usr/local/bastille/templates/username/base-template/PKG
echo "/usr/bin/chsh -s /usr/local/bin/zsh" > /usr/local/bastille/templates/username/base-template/CMD
echo "usr" > /usr/local/bastille/templates/username/base-template/OVERLAY
```

Template hooks are executed in specific order and require specific syntax to
work as expected. This table outlines that order and those requirements:

| SUPPORTED | format              | example                                        |
|-----------|---------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| LIMITS    | resource value      | memoryuse 1G                                   |
| INCLUDE   | template path/URL   | http?://TEMPLATE_URL or username/base-template |
| PRE       | /bin/sh command     | mkdir -p /usr/local/path                       |
| FSTAB     | fstab syntax        | /host/path container/path nullfs ro 0 0        |
| PKG       | port/pkg name(s)    | vim-console zsh git-lite tree htop             |
| OVERLAY   | paths (one/line)    | etc usr                                        |
| SYSRC     | sysrc command(s)    | nginx_enable=YES                               |
| SERVICE   | service command(s)  | nginx restart                                  |
| CMD       | /bin/sh command     | /usr/bin/chsh -s /usr/local/bin/zsh            |

| PLANNED | format           | example                                                        |
|---------|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| PF      | pf rdr entry     | rdr pass inet proto tcp from any to any port 80 -> 10.17.89.80 |
| LOG     | path             | /var/log/nginx/access.log                                      |

Note: SYSRC requires NO quotes or that quotes (`"`) be escaped. ie; `\"`)

In addition to supporting template hooks, Bastille supports overlaying files
into the container. This is done by placing the files in their full path, using the
template directory as "/".

An example here may help. Think of
`/usr/local/bastille/templates/username/base`, our example template, as the
root of our filesystem overlay. If you create an `etc/hosts` or
`etc/resolv.conf` inside the base template directory, these can be overlayed
into your container.

Note: due to the way FreeBSD segregates user-space, the majority of your
overlayed template files will be in `usr/local`. The few general
exceptions are the `etc/hosts`, `etc/resolv.conf`, and `etc/rc.conf.local`.

After populating `usr/local/` with custom config files that your container will
use, be sure to include `usr` in the template OVERLAY definition. eg;

```shell
echo "etc" > /usr/local/bastille/templates/username/base/OVERLAY
echo "usr" >> /usr/local/bastille/templates/username/base/OVERLAY
```

The above example will include anything under "etc" and "usr" inside
the template. You do not need to list individual files. Just include the
top-level directory name.


Applying Templates
------------------

Containers must be running to apply templates.

Bastille includes a `template` sub-command. This sub-command requires a target
and a template name. As covered in the previous section, template names
correspond to directory names in the `bastille/templates` directory.

```shell
ishmael ~ # bastille template folsom username/base
[folsom]:
Copying files...
Copy complete.
Installing packages.
...[snip]...
Executing final command(s).
chsh: user information updated
Template Complete.

```


bastille top
------------
This one simply runs `top` in that container. This command is interactive, as
`top` is interactive.


bastille htop
-------------
This one simply runs `htop` inside the container. This one is a quick and dirty
addition. note: won't work if you don't have htop installed in the container.


bastille sysrc
--------------
The `sysrc` sub-command allows for safely editing system configuration files.
In container terms, this allows us to toggle on/off services and options at
startup.

```shell
ishmael ~ # bastille sysrc nginx nginx_enable=YES
[nginx]:
nginx_enable: NO -> YES
```

See `man sysrc(8)` for more info.


bastille console
----------------
This sub-command launches a login shell into the container. Default is
password-less root login. If you provide an additional argument of a username
you will be logged in as that user. (user must be created first)

```shell
ishmael ~ # bastille console folsom
[folsom]:

root@folsom:~ #
```

At this point you are logged in to the container and have full shell access.
The system is yours to use and/or abuse as you like. Any changes made inside
the container are limited to the container. 


bastille cp
-----------
This sub-command allows efficiently copying files from host to container(s).

```shell
ishmael ~ # bastille cp ALL /tmp/resolv.conf-cf etc/resolv.conf
[folsom]:
/tmp/resolv.conf-cf -> /usr/local/bastille/jails/folsom/root/etc/resolv.conf

[nginx]:
/tmp/resolv.conf-cf -> /usr/local/bastille/jails/nginx/root/etc/resolv.conf

[squid]:
/tmp/resolv.conf-cf -> /usr/local/bastille/jails/squid/root/etc/resolv.conf

[unbound0]:
/tmp/resolv.conf-cf -> /usr/local/bastille/jails/unbound0/root/etc/resolv.conf
```

bastille-rdr
------------

`bastille rdr` allows you to configure dynamic rdr rules for your containers
without modifying pf.conf (assuming you are using the `bastille0` interface 
for a private network and have enabled `rdr-anchor 'rdr/*'` in /etc/pf.conf 
as described in the Networking section).

```shell
    # bastille rdr --help
    Usage: bastille rdr TARGET [clear] | [list] | [tcp <host_port> <jail_port>] | [udp <host_port> <jail_port>]
    # bastille rdr dev1 tcp 2001 22
    # bastille rdr dev1 list
    rdr on em0 inet proto tcp from any to any port = 2001 -> 10.17.89.1 port 22
    # bastille rdr dev1 udp 2053 53
    # bastille rdr dev1 list
    rdr on em0 inet proto tcp from any to any port = 2001 -> 10.17.89.1 port 22
    rdr on em0 inet proto udp from any to any port = 2053 -> 10.17.89.1 port 53
    # bastille rdr dev1 clear
    nat cleared
```

bastille update
---------------
The `update` command targets a release instead of a container. Because every
container is based on a release, when the release is updated all the containers
are automatically updated as well.

To update all containers based on the 11.2-RELEASE `release`:

Up to date 11.2-RELEASE:
```shell
ishmael ~ # bastille update 11.2-RELEASE
Targeting specified release.
11.2-RELEASE

Looking up update.FreeBSD.org mirrors... 2 mirrors found.
Fetching metadata signature for 11.2-RELEASE from update4.freebsd.org... done.
Fetching metadata index... done.
Inspecting system... done.
Preparing to download files... done.

No updates needed to update system to 11.2-RELEASE-p4.
No updates are available to install.
```

To be safe, you may want to restart any containers that have been updated live.


bastille upgrade
----------------
This sub-command lets you upgrade a release to a new release. Depending on the
workflow this can be similar to a `bootstrap`.

```shell
ishmael ~ # bastille upgrade 11.3-RELEASE 12.0-RELEASE
...
```


bastille verify
---------------
This sub-command scans a bootstrapped release and validates that everything
looks in order. This is not a 100% comprehensive check, but it compares the
release against a "known good" index.

If you see errors or issues here, consider deleting and re-bootstrapping the
release.

It should be noted that releases bootstrapped through Bastille are validated
using `sha256` checksum against the release manifest. Archives that fail
validation are not used.


bastille zfs
------------
This sub-command allows managing zfs attributes for the targeted container(s).
Common usage includes setting container quotas.

**set quota**
```shell
ishmael ~ # bastille zfs folsom set quota=1G
```

**built-in: df**
```shell
ishmael ~ # bastille zfs ALL df
```

**built-in: df**
```shell
ishmael ~ # bastille zfs folsom df
```

bastille export
----------------
Containers can be exported for archiving purposes easily.
Note: On UFS systems containers must be stopped before export.

```shell
ishmael ~ # bastille export folsom
Exporting 'folsom' to a compressed .xz archive.
Sending zfs data stream...
  100 %     1057.2 KiB / 9231.5 KiB = 0.115                   0:01             
Exported '/usr/local/bastille/jails/backups/folsom_2020-01-26-19:23:04.xz' successfully.

```

bastille import
----------------
Containers can be imported from supported archives easily.

```shell
ishmael ~ # bastille import folsom_2020-01-26-19:22:23.xz
Validating file: folsom_2020-01-26-19:22:23.xz...
File validation successful!
Importing 'folsom' from compressed .xz archive.
Receiving zfs data stream...
/usr/local/bastille/jails/backups/folsom_2020-01-26-19:22:23.xz (1/1)
  100 %      626.4 KiB / 9231.5 KiB = 0.068                   0:02             
Container 'folsom' imported successfully.
```

Example (create, start, console)
================================
This example creates, starts and consoles into the container.

```shell
ishmael ~ # bastille create alcatraz 11.2-RELEASE 10.17.89.7

RELEASE: 11.2-RELEASE.
NAME: alcatraz.
IP: 10.17.89.7.
```

```shell
ishmael ~ # bastille start alcatraz
[alcatraz]:
alcatraz: created
```

```shell
ishmael ~ # bastille console alcatraz
[alcatraz]:

Project Goals
=============
These tools are created initially with the mindset of function over form. I
want to simply prove the concept is sound for real work. The real work is a
sort of meta-container-port system. Instead of installing the MySQL port
directly on a system, you would use Bastille to install the MySQL port within a
container template built for MySQL. The same goes for DNS servers, and
everything else in the ports tree.

Eventually I would like to have Bastille templates created for popular
FreeBSD-based services. From Plex Media Servers to ad-blocking DNS resolvers.
From tiny SSH containers to dynamic web servers. [COMPLETE]

I don't want to tell you what you can and can't run within this framework.
There are no arbitrary limitations based on what I think may or may not be the
best way to design systems. This is not my goal.

My goal is to provide a secure framework where processes and services can run
isolated. I want to limit the scope and reach of bad actors. I want to severely
limit the target areas available to anyone that has (or has gained) access.

Networking Tips
===============

Tip #1: 
-------
Ports and destinations can be defined as lists. eg;
```
rdr pass inet proto tcp from any to any port {80, 443} -> {10.17.89.45, 10.17.89.46, 10.17.89.47, 10.17.89.48}
```

This rule would redirect any traffic to the host on ports 80 or 443 and
round-robin between containers with ips 45, 46, 47, and 48 (on ports 80 or
443).


Tip #2: 
-------
Ports can redirect to other ports. eg;
```
rdr pass inet proto tcp from any to any port 8080 -> 10.17.89.5 port 80
rdr pass inet proto tcp from any to any port 8081 -> 10.17.89.5 port 8080
rdr pass inet proto tcp from any to any port 8181 -> 10.17.89.5 port 443
```

Tip #3:
-------
Don't worry too much about IP assignments.

Initially I spent time worrying about what IP addresses to assign. In the end
I've come to the conclusion that it _really_ doesn't matter. Pick *any* private
address and be done with it.  These are all isolated networks. In the end, what
matters is you can map host:port to container:port reliably, and we can.
